DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is the source code to MaxRexx V1.2, a special door for Maxs BBS
which lets you create doors in the AREXX scripting language.

COMPILING
---------

MaxRexx doesn't use any additional modules which aren't supplied
in the standard Amiga E distribution, so providing they are in
the same location, recompilation should be as simple as typing

ec maxrexx.e

USAGE
-----

You can pretty much use the source code for anything you like. It
can be redistributed, or used as part of another project,
commercial or otherwise.


DISCLAIMER
----------

Use entirely at your own risk and you accept in full any
consequences from such use. No exceptions.
